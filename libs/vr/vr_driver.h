/** \defgroup VR Virtual Reality
  The library cgv/libs/vr is the basis for implementing vr apps. 
  The library is completely independent of the cgv framework and does
  not include any frameword headers nor does it link to any other framework libraries.
  It builds on the concept of a \a driver implemented in the vr::vr_driver class,
  which provides instances of <em>vr kits</em>. 
  There can be several drivers in use at the same time. A simple registry is used to manage 
  drivers and vr kits. The class vr::vr_kit provides access to the head mounted display and 
  the controllers with a simple state polling api.
  @{
*/

/** @file 
  defines the class vr::vr_driver class and gives access to the driver registry with
  the functions vr::register_driver() and vr::get_drivers(). Furthermore, vr kits can
  be scanned for in all registered drivers via the function vr::scan_vr_kits(), which 
  returns a vector of device handles. The vr kits can be accessed from their device handles
  with the vr::get_vr_kit() function.
